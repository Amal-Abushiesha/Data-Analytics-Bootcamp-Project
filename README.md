## Project Description
Briefly describe what this project does, its purpose, and any relevant background. For example:

> This project is a data analysis tool focused on evaluating patient demographics, satisfaction, and operational efficiency in hospitals. It provides insights into patient admission trends, satisfaction levels by department, and operational metrics, utilizing Python for data processing and Tableau for interactive dashboards.

## Features
- **Hospital Admission Trends**: Analyzes patient admissions over time, identifying peak periods and seasonal patterns.
- **Patient Satisfaction Analysis**: Uses Tableau to create heatmaps and dynamic filters to explore satisfaction levels across departments.
- **Operational Efficiency Metrics**: Visualizes patient wait times and surgery durations in Power BI, offering insights into efficiency.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amal-Abushiesha/Data-Analytics-Bootcamp-Project.git
    cd Data-Analytics-Bootcamp-Project
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up Tableau and Power BI:**
   - Import the respective data files into Tableau and Power BI for visualization.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and format your data. The processed data will be saved to a new file for each analysis.
    ```bash
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. **Hospital Admission Trends**: Use the time-series script to generate daily, weekly, and monthly admission trends.
    ```bash
    python analyze_admission_trends.py
    ```

3. **Patient Satisfaction Analysis in Tableau**:
   - Open Tableau, import `patient_satisfaction_data.csv`, and follow the dashboard guide in the repository to set up interactive visualizations.

4. **Operational Efficiency in Power BI**:
   - Import `operational_data.csv` into Power BI, and use the provided `.pbix` template to explore performance metrics.
